# hello-source-control
All of my knowledge of GitHub and Git no longer fits on the back side of my business card. I should really get a firmer grasp on this aspect of development work. Beyond clicking a few buttons or running a shell script to indicate that I am done my ticket, I only know what source control is for, and the concepts of branch, feature, hotfix, maybe tags, etc.

Your read me files almost invariable suck. You like so many other developers are uncertain what belongs in the read me. And that is fair. I think it should be brief. Create other documents. List them in the read me. No more than 8 paragraphs and 4 lists.
